# E-Commerce Database Project

Welcome to the Power Learn Project group assignment by **Dalton Oballah**. This repository contains a fully designed and documented SQL schema for an e-commerce platform. The goal was to create a clean, scalable, and modular database structure that can support real-world e-commerce operations.

## Overview

This database schema covers everything from brands, product categories, variations, custom attributes, to media references like images â€” all designed with normalization and flexibility in mind.

## Features

- Structured product and variation modeling (size, color, etc.)
- Flexible attribute system (custom fields like material, weight)
- Scalable category system for products and sizes
- Brand linking and image references
- Clean foreign key relationships and data integrity

## Technologies Used

- **SQL** (MySQL-compatible)
- Can be deployed using MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MariaDB with minimal adjustments

## ER Diagram

You can find the ER diagram visualizing the database relationships in the `/assets/` folder or in the repo root as `ecommerce-er.png`.

## Getting Started

To use the database:
1. Install MySQL or a compatible SQL engine.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-database.git
   cd ecommerce-database
